- `OSPlaygroundCode/`: Contains code related to the operating system playground.
- `client/`: Includes the client-side implementation.
- `server/`: Includes the server-side implementation.
- `include/`: Houses various header files and modules.
  - `Actions/`: Contains action-related headers.
  - `Networking/`: Networking-related headers.
  - `RequestBuilder/`: Headers for building requests.
  - `SystemManager/`: System management headers.

## Key Components

### OSPlaygroundCode

This directory includes the codebase for experimenting with various OS-level functionalities. It serves as a playground for testing and developing new features.

### Include

The `include` directory is structured into several subdirectories, each focusing on different aspects of the tool:

- **Actions**: This module defines various actions that can be performed by the tool. Each action is encapsulated in a header file.
- **Networking**: This module provides networking capabilities, including socket management, data transmission, and network protocols.
- **RequestBuilder**: This module handles the construction of requests. It includes utilities for creating and formatting requests to be sent to the server.
- **SystemManager**: This module is responsible for system management tasks. It includes functionalities for monitoring system resources, managing processes, and handling system configurations.
